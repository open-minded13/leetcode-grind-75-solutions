# Time Complexity: O(N*M), where N is the number of coins and M is the number of
#                  the amount variable.
#
#                  Outer Loop (Coins Loop): This loop iterates over each coin in the coins array.
#                  If there are n coins, this loop runs n times.
#
#                  Inner Loop (Amount Loop): For each coin, the inner loop iterates through
#                  all the amounts from the coin value up to the desired amount.
#                  If the amount we are trying to make is M, this loop runs M times for each coin.
#
#                  In the worst-case scenario (where coins = [1, 2, 3, ..., M]),
#                  the number of iterations for the inner loop can be summed up as follows:
#
#                  For coin 1: Iterates M times
#                  For coin 2: Iterates M - 1 times
#                  For coin 3: Iterates M - 2 times
#                  ...
#                  For coin m: Iterates 1 time
#
#                  So, the total number of iterations in the worst-case scenario is
#                  the sum of the first m natural numbers, which is M * (M+1) / 2.
#                  This sum is in the order of O(M^2).
#
# Space Complexity: O(M), where M is the number of the amount variable.
#                   We create a one-dimensional array of size M + 1 (including amount 0 to M).
#                   This array is used to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount.
