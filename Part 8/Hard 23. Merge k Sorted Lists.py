# Date of Last Practice: Jan 21, 2024
#
# Time Complexity: O(N * log K), where N is the number of all nodes,
#                  and K is the number of linked lists.
#                  We insert (heappush) and extract (heappop) once for each node.
#                  For each heap operation, we took O(log K) to complete
#                  since the max size of the min_heap is K.
#
# Space Complexity: O(K), where K is the number of linked list.
