> NOTE: This repository is marked as complete and I have stopped updating it. If you'd like to see well-commented (PEP8 and Google style) and optimized solutions, check out my [**LeetCode Grind 169**](https://github.com/open-minded13/leetcode-grind-169-solutions) repository!

[**Grind 75**](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) is a dynamic list of top LeetCode interview questions created in 2023. It's up-to-date and well-chosen, and we can personalize it according to our schedule, time constraints, and preferences.

[**Blind 75**](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU), on the other hand, is a curated list of LeetCode questions created in 2018. We can practice these questions to save time in the job-finding process. Many other LeetCode problems are technical mixes of these individual problems. I practice Blind 75 in parallel on this [**repository**](https://github.com/open-minded13/2023_LeetCode_Blind_75_Questions_Challenge).

To achieve the review of the application of the following data structures and algorithms, except the theory of NP-Completeness.

- Data Structures: (1) Arrays; (2) Stacks and Queues; (3) Linked Lists; (4) Trees; (5) Graphs; (6) Sorting; (7) Hashing.
- Algorithms: (1) Greedy Method; (2) Divide and Conquer; (3) Tree Searching Strategies; (4) Prune and Search; (5) Dynamic Programming.
