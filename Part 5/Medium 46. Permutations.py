# Time Complexity: O(N!), where N is the amount of the input nums.
#                  The recursion depth is N (since we are generating permutations of N elements),
#                  and at each level, we are iterating N times. However, due to the used_num constraint,
#                  the actual number of iterations decreases as the recursion depth increases:
#                  At the first level, there are N options.
#                  At the second level, there are N-1 options, and so on.
#                  This results in N * (N-1) * (N-2) * ... * 1, which is N!.
#
# Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the amount of the input nums.
#                   The maximum depth of the recursive call stack is N
#                   as we explore each element for permutations.
#                   The maximum size of the combination list is N.
#                   The size of used_num is always N.
