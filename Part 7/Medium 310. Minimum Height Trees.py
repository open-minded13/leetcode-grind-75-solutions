# Date of Last Practice: Jan 14, 2024
#
# Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
#                  Each node is removed once, and their edge reductions can be done in O(1).
# Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
#                   The adj_list and leaves are dominant issues for storage.
#
# Centroid Decomposition: The concept of finding centroids in a tree is central to this problem.
#                         In a tree, a centroid is a node that, if removed,
#                         would split the tree into subtrees none of which
#                         is larger than half the size of the original tree.
#                         For the minimum height trees, the centroids will be the roots.
#                         NOTE: "A tree can have at most 2 centroids."
#
# Pruning the Tree: The algorithm starts by identifying all leaf nodes (nodes with only one neighbor).
#                   These leaves are then pruned from the tree, and the process is repeated.
#                   As leaves are pruned, the new leaf nodes are identified in the reduced tree.
#                   This process continues until only one or two nodes remain,
#                   which are the centroids of the tree.
#
# Adjacency List: This is used to represent the tree.
#                 Each node in the list maintains a set of its adjacent nodes (neighbors).
#                 NOTE: The use of a set for each node's neighbors makes it easy and fast to
#                 add or remove edges in O(1), which is crucial for this problem.
#                 Compared to list.remove(), it takes O(N) to remove the item.
