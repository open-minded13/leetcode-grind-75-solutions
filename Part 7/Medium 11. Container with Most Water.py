# Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input list (height).
#                  This is because the algorithm iterates over the list once in a loop.
#                  Each iteration performs constant time operations, such as comparisons and arithmetic calculations.
#
# Space Complexity: O(1). The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space
#                   to store variables (max_area, left, and right).
#                   Regardless of the size of the input list, the amount of memory used by the algorithm remains the same.


# Optimized Solution: Two-Pointer Technique
# In each iteration, we move the pointer with the smaller height towards the center.
# This is because moving the pointer with the larger height will only decrease the width
# and can never increase the area.
