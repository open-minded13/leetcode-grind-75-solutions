from typing import List

# Date of Last Practice: Oct 29, 2023
#
# Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the amount of numbers in the list.
#                  This is because we use a for loop to iterate the "nums" list .
# Space Complexity: O(1) because we use a constant amount of extra space to store two variables.
#
# Moore Voting Algorithm: The algorithm is based on the fun fact that the majority element will always survive
#                         during the process of count-based elimination.
#                         The algorithm's core idea is picking a candidate, pairing it with others,
#                         and ensuring the majority element can survive through the elimination process.
