# Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the s string.
#
# Space Complexity: O(1). For the Counter object, the solution uses 54 additional spaces
#                         (to create a Counter's dictionary-like object)
#                         because the number of distinct lowercase and uppercase letters.
#                         Other variables like single_letter_exists and
#                         longest_palindrome_length require 2 space.
#                         Overall, O(26) + O(2) can be considered as O(1).
