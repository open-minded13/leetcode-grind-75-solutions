# Date of Last Practice: Nov 19, 2023
#
# Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of tokens in the input list.
#                  This is because we iterate through each token once.
#
# Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the graph.
#                   This is because the number of stacks we use is proportional to the number of tokens.
#                   In the worst case, when all operators are put at the end of the tokens list,
#                   we will use almost N stacks to store operands.
