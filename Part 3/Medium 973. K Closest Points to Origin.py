#
# Time Complexity: O(N * log K), where N is the number of tokens in the input list.
#                  This is because we iterate over each point, and in each iteration,
#                  we perform heap operations (i.e. heappush() and heappop())
#                  with a time complexity of log K.
#
# Space Complexity: O(N),

# Heapify != Heap Operations
# Note: Heapify, on the other hand, is a different operation.
#       Heapify is considered to have a time complexity of O(N) rather than O(N * log N) because,
#       during the bottom-up construction of the heap, each node's movement towards
#       its correct position involves a constant number of comparisons and swaps.
#       Although the overall height of the heap tree is logarithmic (O(log N)),
#       the majority of the subtrees during construction have relatively small heights.
#       This characteristic allows us to treat the heapify operation as
#       having a constant factor per node rather than a logarithmic one.
#       Consequently, the linear relationship between the number of elements (N)
#       and the total number of operations performed for heapify results in
#       a time complexity of O(N).
#       Additionally, in practical terms, the slow growth of the iterated logarithm function log* N
#       further supports treating heapify as a linear operation for realistic input sizes."
